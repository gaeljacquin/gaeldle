A collection of video game guessing challenges. Test your gaming knowledge across six different modes, each with its own mechanics and difficulty level.

## Game Modes

### Cover Art (Easy)

Identify the mystery game from its cover art. The image starts fully pixelated and gradually becomes clearer with each wrong guess.

**How to play:**
- A pixelated cover image is shown on screen along with a clarity bar indicating how revealed the image is
- Search for a game by name and select it from the list
- Submit your guess
- A wrong guess costs one attempt and sharpens the image
- You have **5 attempts** to identify the game

---

### Artwork (Medium)

Similar to Cover Art, but instead of a box cover you are shown in-game artwork or a wallpaper for the mystery title. The image starts pixelated and clears up as you use attempts.

**How to play:**
- A pixelated artwork image is shown along with a clarity bar
- Search for a game by name and select it from the list
- Submit your guess
- A wrong guess costs one attempt and sharpens the image
- You have **5 attempts** to identify the game

---

### Image Gen (Medium)

An AI-generated image representing the mystery game is shown in full from the start. The image is an artistic interpretation, not official art, so you will need to read into the visual clues.

**How to play:**
- An AI-generated image is shown on screen (no pixelation)
- Search for a game by name and select it from the list
- Submit your guess
- A wrong guess costs one attempt; the image does not change
- You have **5 attempts** to identify the game

---

### Timeline (Medium)

Ten games are dealt to you in a random order. Arrange them all into the correct chronological order by release date.

**How to play:**
- Ten game cards are displayed in a row
- Drag and drop the cards to rearrange them from oldest to newest
- Use the **Shift** mode (default) to slide cards into a new position, or switch to **Swap** mode to exchange two cards directly
- When you are happy with your order, click **Submit**
- Cards placed in the correct position turn green and become locked; incorrectly placed cards turn red and remain movable
- You have **3 attempts** to get the full order right
- Win by placing all ten games in the correct chronological order

---

### Timeline 2 (Hard)

A growing timeline is built one card at a time. For each round a new game card is dealt to you and you must drag it into the right chronological slot on the timeline.

**How to play:**
- A starting game card with its release date is placed on the timeline automatically
- A new card is dealt to you with its release date hidden
- Drag the dealt card and drop it into the position you think is chronologically correct on the timeline
- A correct placement adds the card to the timeline and reveals its date; an incorrect placement also adds the card at its correct position but costs an attempt
- The next card is then dealt and the process repeats
- You have **7 mistakes** before the game ends
- Your score is the number of cards you placed correctly

---

### Specifications (Hard)

Deduce the mystery game by guessing games and comparing their specifications against the target. Each guess reveals how closely the guessed game matches across eight categories.

**How to play:**
- Search for a game by name and submit it as your guess
- A comparison grid shows how each of the eight specifications match the target game:
  - **Green** — exact match
  - **Yellow** — partial match (some overlap)
  - **Red** — no match
- The eight compared specifications are: Platforms, Genres, Themes, Release Year, Game Modes, Game Engines, Publisher, and Player Perspective
- Use the results to narrow down your next guess
- You may reveal one hint at any time for **-1 attempt**; the hint reveals the correct value of a randomly chosen unmatched specification
- You have **10 attempts** to guess the correct game
